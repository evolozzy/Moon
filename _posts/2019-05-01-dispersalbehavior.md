**Aim:** To find the environmental and genetic factors contributing to dispersal behavior

In this experiment, we adopted a tail based approach to investigate the genetic basis of dispersal. We connected two pairs of large scale experimental mesocosms that are ~15m apart. For each treatment, we released ~30000 flies from one side and collected flies from both sides after 24 hours of dispersal. Fitness and dispersal related phenotypes of F2 progeny of these flies were measured. Along with these we have collected very fine scale weather and environmental data.
