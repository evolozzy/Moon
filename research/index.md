The ecological genetics of natural populations, and the effects of it on adaptation is loosely understood. In this broad topic, Iâ€™m interested in migration and the contributions of migration to adapdation. My current aim is to understand the migration selection balance in natural populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, in various temporal and spatial settings. To achieve this, in my research, I use field collections, indoor and experimental outdoor populations, and various experimental and computational methods to analyze them.

# Ongoing research:  
1. Effects of migration on adaptation 
2. Population genetics of *D. melanogaster* in North America from mtDNA analysis 
3. Basis of dispersal behavior
