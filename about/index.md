<br />
The ecological genetics of natural populations, and the effects of it on rapid adaptation is one of the topics that captures the interest of many scientists. In this broad topic, Iâ€™m interested in migration/gene flow dynamics and the contributions of gene flow to rapid adapdation. <br />
<br />
Currently, I focus on understanding the migration-selection balance in natural populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i> in various temporal and spatial settings, as well as their dispersal and the factors contributing to it.<br />
<br />
To achieve this, in my research, I use *D. melanogaster*, collected from their natural habitat, to create experimental populations. Using these populations, I design and conduct large scale lab- and field-based experiments, where I can observe population scale changes.</span></p>
