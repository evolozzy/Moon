The ecological genetics of natural populations, and the effects of it on adaptation is loosely understood. In this broad topic, Iâ€™m interested in migration and the contributions of migration to adapdation. My current aim is to understand the migration selection balance in natural populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, in various temporal and spatial settings. To achieve this, in my research, I use field collections, indoor and experimental outdoor populations, and various experimental and computational methods to analyze them.</span></p>
